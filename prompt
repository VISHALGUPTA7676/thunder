In JavaScript, `prompt` is a built-in function that displays a dialog box prompting the user to enter some input. It is often used to gather information from users in a simple and straightforward manner. The `prompt` function pauses the execution of the script until the user provides input and clicks "OK" or cancels the dialog.

### Syntax

```javascript
let userInput = prompt(message, default);
```

### Parameters

1. **message** (optional): A string that specifies the message to display in the dialog box, asking the user for input.
2. **default** (optional): A string that sets the default value in the input field of the dialog box. This is optional.

### Return Value

- The `prompt` function returns the input value as a string if the user clicks "OK". If the user clicks "Cancel", it returns `null`.

### Example

Here's a simple example that uses `prompt` to ask the user for their name:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Prompt Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Prompt the user for their name
        let name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
        
        // Check if the user clicked "Cancel"
        if (name !== null) {
            alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
        } else {
            alert("User cancelled the prompt.");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Points to Note

1. **Blocking**: The `prompt` function is synchronous, meaning it blocks the execution of code until the user provides input or cancels the dialog.
2. **Browser Compatibility**: While `prompt` is widely supported across browsers, it may not provide a consistent user experience, especially in modern web applications. Users often prefer more customized forms or modal dialogs.
3. **Input Type**: The input collected from `prompt` is always returned as a string. You may need to convert it to the appropriate type (e.g., number) for further processing.

### Summary

The `prompt` function is a quick way to collect user input in JavaScript. However, for more complex applications, itâ€™s often better to use HTML forms or custom modal dialogs for better user experience and more control over the input process.
