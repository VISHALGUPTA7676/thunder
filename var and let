In JavaScript, `let` and `var` are both used to declare variables, but they have important differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and redeclaration. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. Scope

- **`var`:** 
  - Function-scoped: A variable declared with `var` is only accessible within the function in which it is declared. If declared outside a function, it is globally scoped.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    function example() {
        if (true) {
            var x = 10;
        }
        console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
    }
    example();
    ```

- **`let`:**
  - Block-scoped: A variable declared with `let` is only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (enclosed by `{}`), which includes loops, if statements, and other blocks.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    function example() {
        if (true) {
            let y = 20;
            console.log(y); // Outputs: 20
        }
        // console.log(y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
    }
    example();
    ```

### 2. Hoisting

- **`var`:**
  - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means you can reference a `var` variable before its declaration, but it will be `undefined` until the line where it’s defined is executed.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined
    var a = 5;
    ```

- **`let`:**
  - Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they cannot be accessed before their declaration due to a concept called the "temporal dead zone." Accessing it before declaration will throw a `ReferenceError`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    // console.log(b); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
    let b = 10;
    ```

### 3. Redeclaration

- **`var`:**
  - You can redeclare a variable using `var` within the same scope without any errors.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    var c = 1;
    var c = 2; // No error
    console.log(c); // Outputs: 2
    ```

- **`let`:**
  - You cannot redeclare a variable using `let` in the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a `SyntaxError`.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    let d = 1;
    // let d = 2; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared
    ```

### Summary

- Use **`var`** when you need function-scoped variables and don’t mind redeclaration.
- Use **`let`** when you want block-scoped variables and want to prevent redeclaration.

In modern JavaScript, it’s generally recommended to use `let` (or `const` for constants) instead of `var` for better scoping and to avoid potential issues. Let me know if you have any further questions!
