To install Angular CLI for Angular 12, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Angular CLI requires Node.js version 12.0 or later. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Angular CLI**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli@12
   ```

   This command installs Angular CLI globally on your system.

3. **Verify Installation**: After the installation completes, verify that Angular CLI is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   ng version
   ```

   This command should display the version of Angular CLI and other related packages.

4. **Create a New Angular Project**: To create a new Angular project using Angular 12, run:

   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app --version=12
   ```

   Replace `my-angular-app` with your desired project name.

5. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd my-angular-app
   ```

6. **Serve the Application**: Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your Angular app in action.

That's it! You now have Angular CLI installed and a new Angular 12 project set up. If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
