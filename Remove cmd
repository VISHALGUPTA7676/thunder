To uninstall Angular CLI, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
```

This command removes Angular CLI from your global npm packages.

### Verify Uninstallation

To confirm that Angular CLI has been removed, you can run:

```bash
ng version
```

If Angular CLI is uninstalled successfully, you should see a message indicating that the command is not found or that the CLI is not installed.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!
